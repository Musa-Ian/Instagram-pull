A modern web application for downloading Instagram posts, stories, and reels with seamless iOS Shortcuts integration.

Built by **Ian Musa**

## Features

- üéØ **Download Everything**: Handles single photos, carousel posts, reels, and videos.
- üì± **iOS Shortcuts Integration**: One-tap downloading from the Instagram app.
- üöÄ **No External APIs**: Works directly with Instagram, no third-party services or keys required.
- üé® **Modern & Responsive UI**: Clean and easy to use on any device.
- üîí **Privacy-Focused**: No login required. All processing happens on the server.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (React)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-pull.git
cd instagram-pull
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Run the development server:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How It Works

This application uses a custom-built scraper that fetches media information directly from Instagram's GraphQL API. This method is more robust and reliable than legacy approaches.

1.  **Input**: Takes a public Instagram post URL.
2.  **Extraction**: The backend makes a server-side request to Instagram's internal API to retrieve the post's data, including direct links to all photos and videos.
3.  **Response**: Returns a clean JSON object with CDN URLs for all media, which can be downloaded directly.

**No API keys or external services are required!**

## iOS Shortcuts Integration

Set up a shortcut to download any Instagram post directly from the share sheet.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create a New Shortcut**
    - Open the **Shortcuts** app and tap the **+** icon to create a new shortcut.
    - Tap "Add Action".

2.  **Receive Input from Share Sheet**
    - Search for and add the **"Get URL from Input"** action. This allows the shortcut to accept the Instagram link when you use the Share button in the app.
    - Tap the blue "Any" text and ensure that **"Shortcut Input"** is selected.

3.  **Make the API Request**
    - Search for and add the **"Get Contents of URL"** action.
    - Configure it as follows:
        - **URL**: `https://your-deployed-app-url.com/api/download` (Replace with your Vercel URL).
        - **Method**: Tap "GET" and change it to **POST**.
        - **Headers**: Add **two** headers:
            - **Header 1**:
              - **Key**: `Content-Type`
              - **Text**: `application/json`
            - **Header 2 (Important for reliability)**:
              - **Key**: `X-Client-Type`
              - **Text**: `shortcut`
        - **Request Body**: Select **JSON** and add a new field:
            - **Key**: `url`
            - **Text**: Tap the "Text" field, select the "Magic Wand" icon (or variable icon), and choose **URL**. This passes the Instagram link to the API.

4.  **Process the Response**
    - Add a **"Get Dictionary from Input"** action. Set the input to **Contents of URL**.
    - Add a **"Get Dictionary Value"** action. Set the key to **media**. This extracts the list of media items.

5.  **Loop Through Media and Download**
    - Add a **"Repeat with Each"** action. The input should automatically be the **Dictionary Value** from the previous step.
    - Inside the `Repeat` block, add another **"Get Dictionary Value"** action. Set the key to **url**. This gets the direct download URL for each photo/video.
    - Finally, add a **"Save to Photo Album"** action. The input should be the **Dictionary Value** from the step above. You can choose which album to save to.

6.  **Name and Configure the Shortcut**
    - Give your shortcut a name (e.g., "Insta-Pull").
    - Tap the **(i)** icon at the bottom and enable **"Show in Share Sheet"**. This makes it accessible from Instagram.

Now, go to any public Instagram post, tap the Share button, and select "Insta-Pull" from the list to download all its media!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"CSRF token not found"**
   - This is temporary - Instagram sometimes blocks requests
   - Wait a few minutes and try again
   - Try with a different post

2. **"No media found"**
   - Check if the post is public
   - Verify the URL is correct
   - Some posts might have restricted content

3. **Download fails**
   - The media URL might have expired
   - Try processing the URL again

### Tips for Best Results

- Use public Instagram posts
- Copy the URL directly from Instagram
- Don't make too many requests in quick succession
- If one post fails, try another
